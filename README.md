## Project Goals
- Understand key factors influencing car prices.
- Cluster cars based on price, engine specifications, and battery capacity.
- Predict car prices using machine learning models.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and provides comprehensive information on cars for the year 2024.

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Year**: Manufacturing year of the car.
- **Cars Prices**: Price of the car (in USD).
- **Engines**: Type of engine (e.g., V6, V8).
- **CC/Battery Capacity**: Engine displacement or battery capacity (in CC or kWh).
- **Fuel Types**: Type of fuel used (e.g., gasoline, diesel, electric).

---

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Removed non-numeric characters from columns like `CC/Battery Capacity`.
   - Handled missing values in the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized trends in pricing, engine specifications, and fuel types.
   - Explored relationships between mileage and pricing.
3. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Applied **Random Forest Regressor** for price prediction.
   - Clustered cars using **KMeans** to identify groups based on specifications.
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for engine types).
   - Added a `Year` column for time-based trends.

## Methods Used
- **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`
- **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Converted string-based numeric columns to float.
- **Clustering**:
   - Used KMeans to group cars into clusters based on features like price and engine size.
- **Regression**:
   - Trained a Random Forest model to predict car prices based on numerical features.

---

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.7+
   - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Run the Project**:
   - Load the dataset using `pandas.read_csv()`.
   - Execute the Jupyter notebook step by step.

---

## Key Insights
1. **High Variance in Car Prices**:
   - Prices ranged significantly, with a mean distorted by extreme values.
2. **Clusters Identified**:
   - Cars were grouped into 4 clusters based on price, engine specifications, and battery capacities.
3. **Feature Importance**:
   - Engine size and battery capacity were key factors in determining car prices.

---

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional features, such as brand and region, to improve predictions.
- Explore deep learning models for more accurate clustering and regression.
- Build a dashboard for interactive data visualization.
